         A. Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language. Being a general-purpose language, it can be used to build almost any type of application with the right tools/libraries

        A. An interpreted language is any programming language which is not in machine-level code before runtime. Therefore, Python is an interpreted language.

   </header>

   <p class="description">
     A. Before we understand a dynamically typed language, we should learn about what typing is. Typing refers to type-checking in programming languages. In a strongly-typed language, such as Python, "1" + 2 will result in a type error since these languages don't allow for "type-coercion" (implicit conversion of data types). On the other hand, a weakly-typed language, such as Javascript, will simply output "12" as result.

       <p class="description">
         A. PEP stands for <b>Python Enhancement Proposal</b>. A PEP is an official design document providing information to the Python community, or describing a new feature for Python or its processes. PEP 8 is especially important since it documents the style guidelines for Python Code. Apparently contributing to the Python open-source community requires you to follow these style guidelines sincerely and strictly.

         1. Easy to use– Python is a high-level programming language that is easy to use, read, write and learn.<br>  
         2. Interpreted language– Since python is interpreted language, it executes the code line by line and stops if an error  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;occurs in any line.<br>  
         3. Dynamically typed– the developer does not assign data types to variables at the time of coding. It automatically  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;gets assigned during execution.<br>  
         4. Free and open-source– Python is free to use and distribute. It is open source.<br>  
         5. Extensive support for libraries– Python has vast libraries that contain almost any function needed. It also further  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;provides the facility to import other packages using Python Package Manager(pip).<br>  
         6. Portable– Python programs can run on any platform without requiring any change.<br>  
         7. The data structures used in python are user friendly.<br>  
         8. It provides more functionality with less coding.<br>

           <i class="fa-solid fa-plus"></i>
       </header>

       <p class="description">
         A. Lists and Tuples are both sequence data types that can store a collection of objects in Python. The objects stored in both sequences can have different data types. Lists are represented with square brackets ['sara', 6, 0.19], while tuples are represented with parantheses ('ansh', 5, 0.97).
